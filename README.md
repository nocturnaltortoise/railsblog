# railsblog
I started this following the Ruby on Rails Getting Started tutorial (http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html).
However, I wanted to mess around with other things, like SCSS, AJAX, and general frontend stuff as well as the backend,
so I'm building on the foundations of the tutorial to make something a  bit more interesting hopefully.
