#Things To Do

- change the **nav design**?
  - bit boring at the moment, bit too PCGamer - maybe try a sidenav
    - burger menu maybe?
- make things **responsive** - media queries etc
- split up repeated css into **partial scss** files?
- **edit, delete post links**
- think about design for new post/index pages
  - easier to use, more organic **user experience** - **ajax**?
    - more of a "whiteboard" type experience perhaps - editing and adding new posts done with single clicks?
